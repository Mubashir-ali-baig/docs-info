# Grants and Full-time Opportunities

Grants are provided for any short-term (2 to 6 week) contribution to the DAO. You may propose work outside of this list. You may also apply without having a specific piece of work in mind. Grants can be used as a low-commitment means to transition to a full-time role. Full-time roles can be directly offered as well. Pay is negotiable.

Each taskforce may have their own grants and onboarding process.

**Apply here:** [Contributors onboarding form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexJhf3HFr4bPRXIwn6MYKdGJrMFmvP-h1Co-k1DgJ0uP0yTg/viewform).

We regularly go through the responses and will contact you shortly. We also have dedicated channels for grants and community contributors in our [discord](http://discord.gg/mtb6W57Ap6).

_Looking forward to having you as a contributor to the Rari Capital DAO!_

## Infrastructure: Frontend

<summary> Opportunities available </summary>

<details>

#### Build an embeddable widget to interact with Fuse Pools. (2000 USDC or RGT equiv.)
<u>Criteria:</u> Build an embeddable widget that other websites can use to embed Fuse Pools directly in their site, such that people can borrow and lend on a Fuse Pool directly through this interface. It should aim to offer some visual customization as well.

<u>Why?:</u> More defi projects are hosting and seeding their own Fuse pools to provide greater capital productivity on that project's assets. With an embeddable Fuse pool widget, users of these projects can now easily access lending and borrowing through another project's interface.

<u>Spec:</u> Recommended technologies: React/Svelte.js, utilizing Rari SDK or direct contract calls. Preferably utilizes Ether.js over web3.js. Must be as lightweight as possible. Must support color customization. Could be built as a node module or a standalone HTML/CSS/JS embed.  

<u><b>Bonus</b> - (<b>300 USDC</b> or RGT equiv):</u> Build 2 additional UIs for this embeddable widget, one that is more fully featured and a "simple" UI, such that a project can choose which UI for Fuse they would like to embed.


#### Design and Implement a robust search service for the Rari Protocol (1000 USDC or RGT equiv.)

<u>Criteria:</u> Design and Build a service that enables efficient and robust search across all Rari Protocol products.

<u>Why?:</u> Currently knowledge on opportunities in the Rari ecosystem is fragmented. There is no current service that efficiently aggregates live data about the best opportunities across all Rari products.

<u>Spec:</u> For any token or a set of tokens, what opportunities across products (Vaults, Fuse, Plugins, Nova (L2), Tranches) exist for this asset? Of these, what are the **best** opportunities and what is their risk level?

<u>Comments:</u> This project would be massively aided by a subgraph. If a developer wants they could tackle both grants at the same time, or work with another dev who is building the subgraph.

#### PWA + Push notifications ( 400 USDC or RGT equiv.)

<u>Criteria:</u> Let’s build a service that keeps track of a user’s activity in Fuse and alerts them via push notifications under different circumstances. IE if they reach a dangerous borrow ratio and are at potential risk of liquidation. Or we could send regular push notifs informing a user about their total position net worth. Up to the user’s discretion.

<u>Why?:</u> This would be badassSpec:The rari-dapp is already a PWA. We can make some tweaks to the PWA logic to implement push notifications. If this ends up not working, we can use http://hal.xyz/


#### Governance Dashboard (400 USDC or RGT equiv).

<u>Criteria:</u> Rari Capital will be moving Governance fully on-chain using GovernerBravo. Build a governance dashboard to support this.

<u>Why?:</u> The dashboard will allow us to keep our governance in-house rather than dependent on Snapshot.

<u>Spec:</u> Figma has designs,

#### UX + Design Audit (600 USDC or RGT equiv)

<u>Criteria:</u> Audit the design and UX of the main Rari Capital site, and offer clear solutions on how to improve it.
