# Security

Securing all Rari Capital products is the most important aspect of this protocol's development process. All code is thoroughly tested and audited before public deployment. Contributors to the protocol care deeply about the code that they produce and proceed through all safety measures before releasing products to our users.

As always, DeFi is experiential technology in the financial sector and you should always do proper research and make your own decisions before interacting with a protocol under Rari Capital.

## Smart Contract Audits

The Rari Capital products have been audited by [Quantstamp](https://quantstamp.com/),[Omniscia](https://omniscia.io/),and [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/). (Some reports are not public yet, but will be shared soon once finalized.)

## Safeguarded Launches

Security and risk management has and will always be a top priority at Rari Capital. Following a guide outlined by [Ken Deeter](https://medium.com/electric-capital/derisking-defi-guarded-launches-2600ce730e0a), we have ensured that every single new product follows our safeguarded approach. The following attributes promote our care towards safety of all our users and ecosystem members:

- Assessing each underlying protocol prior to integration (link to assessment framework [here](https://www.notion.so/Rari-Strategy-Assessment-Framework-2d1edffcf80f4750973f6e90e97b70a4))
- Deposit limit scaling up over time
- Transparent posts
- Open source
- Community focused
- Veteran contributors in crypto and DeFi
- Audits

Every product that launches under Rari Capital goes through its own version of a guarded launch. This has been brought to life from deposit and borrow limits in both the Yield Aggregator and Fuse, and we will continue to slowly unveil all of our upcoming products with safety always top of mind.
